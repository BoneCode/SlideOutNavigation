# What is GSAP?
GSAP is a JavaScript library for building high-performance animations that work in **every** major browser. Animate CSS, SVG, canvas, React, Vue, WebGL, colors, strings, motion paths, generic objects...anything JavaScript can touch! No other library delivers such advanced sequencing, reliability, and tight control while solving real-world problems on millions of sites. GSAP works around countless browser inconsistencies; your animations **just work**. At its core, GSAP is a high-speed property manipulator, updating values over time with extreme accuracy. It's up to 20x faster than jQuery! See https://greensock.com/why-gsap/ for what makes GSAP so special.

# SVGBox
SVGBox is an API for webicons that was used to implement the icons in the navigation bar. "Including icons is harder than it should be. SVGBox allows you to add icons to your project by using simple tags. The idea behind the service is that including icons should be as simple as copy and paste."
